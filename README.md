# lvgl I/O simulator

Simple example of I/O simulator for Linux written in C with lvgl library.

The idea is to have a small application that can be used as an input/output simulator for software testing. A library to be used in master software is in the way of development. I/O information is transmitted via shared memory.

The GUI is minimal and should be updated with more digital and analog inputs and outputs.
